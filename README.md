### Welcome to my GitHub pageðŸ‘‹
These are a collection of my school projects and some of my more presentable game prototypes.

I've made a lot of prototypes for games through the years. Mostly, I get an idea for a game and try to see if the core concept is any fun. And they mostly are not fun. So, it's best to get a bad idea made and out of the way, so I don't waste any more energy on it. Someday, I hope to find a game idea I really enjoy and make a full-fledged game out of it. As prototypes, the code is rough and throwaway by design. If ever I like a concept and decide to follow through with a project, I will then employ the stricter principles of software engineering.

That said, here are a few game prototypes made in Unity3D. These aren't my best works, but they happen to look the prettiest. I like pixel art, as you will tell, and I made the art and animations myself, whch isn't all that impressive, really. But it's practice. I like the NES style mostly and try to use the same, very limited palette.

Any questions or comments, please let me know. Thanks and have fun!
